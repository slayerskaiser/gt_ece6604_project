% Section VI: Summary

This paper compared the performance of various STBC schemes for a flat Rayleigh block-fading channel with AWGN. The simulation results showed that the $C(4,2,4)$ coded had the best tradeoff between implementation simplicity, performance, and spectral efficiency. Additionally, for the particular channel considered by this paper, increasing the speed of the receiver actually increased performance. The authors believe that this is due to the use of MRC at the decoder. This special channel case is likely not realistic so future investigations should consider a more realistic channel.

Extending these results to future 5G technologies, likely using massive MIMO, the authors believe that rate $R=1/2$ OSTBC schemes should be considered. While having a lower rate than QOSTBC schemes as well as MRC with $N_T=1$, for a given BER it was consistently more than 3~dB better than an equivalent diversity code with higher rate. Additionally, the linearity of these codes and the ease of generation using HR families is beneficial for design and use of these codes.
